Project Repository Description

Project Title: MLSMM2153 Web Mining Project: Cultural Criticisms Analysis (Cinema)

This repository contains the full pipeline for the Web Mining course project (Academic Year 2025-2026)  at [Your University/Program Name, if applicable].

The project focuses on Topic 4: Analysis of Cultural Criticisms on Blogs, specifically targeting independent film review blogs.

Core Objectives
Data Collection (Scraping): Automatically collect and structure film reviews, ratings, and associated metadata from selected blogs.

Text Mining: Analyze the corpus to identify dominant themes, vocabulary, and determine the polarity (sentiment) of critiques and their correlation with numerical ratings.

Link Analysis (Web Mining): Construct and analyze a network (graph) of cited works and co-occurring themes within the reviews to identify influential films or structural links between different cinematic genres.


Key Deliverables
The code allows for the full replication of the analysis pipeline, including data preparation, text vectorization, clustering, and the calculation of network metrics (Degree, Betweenness Centrality, PageRank).

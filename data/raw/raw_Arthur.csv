That’s how13-year-old Alpha (Mélissa Boros) fancies herself, reckless and angsty in her adolescent way, kicking against her mother’s (Goldshifteh Farahami) parenting with drinking and smoking and having an affair with her classmate Adrien even though he already has a girlfriend. But if Alpha is the screaming guitars and defiant snarl of Cave’sfirst iteration of this song, her Uncle Amin (Tahar Rahim) is the soul-wrenching resignation ofthe version recorded a quarter of a century later. He turns up mid heroin detox, sprawled on Alpha’s bedroom floor, rail thin, shivering and sweating through his clothes with trackmarks on his arms. Alpha doesn’t recognise him; she threatens him with a knife. Amin just laughs. The stab of a different needle setsAlphainto motion: when the teenager returns from a house party with a crude stick-n-poke tattoo of the letter A on her arm (not quite a scarlet letter but not far off), her mother is understandably angry, but more than that, she’s frightened. A fatal blood-borne illness has swept through society, causing the sick to slowly, painfully turn to stone, and as one of the few doctors willing to treat the sick, she’s witnessed it first hand. Alpha’s cluelessness sends her mother into a tailspin. Amin has already contracted the disease through his drug use and she can’t bear to lose another loved one. The unnamed virus is an obvious stand-in forAIDS, perceived with the same hushed disgust by outsiders. In Alpha’s English class her teacher (Finnegan Oldfield) is subject to homophobic slurs from his students; when Alpha later sees him in the hospital waiting room, accompanying his sick partner, she’s the only person who doesn’t recoil. But the painful transformation of the sick into stone relics is a curious twist. They become monuments to the very thing that killed them, not just the sickness but the treatmentofthe sick – their ostracisation and abandonment. Here Ducournau positions the dead as martyrs, as worthy of a monument as any king or general, a testament to the burden of shame placed upon them by society which placed the blame forAIDSat the feet of theLGBTQ+ community. The burden of shame that reverberated for generations and still isn’t taught in schools, as we slide backwards towards conservatism in our present and run the risk of learning nothing from the past. In school, rumours swirl that Alpha has contracted the virus and she is bullied accordingly – she remains stony-faced, but her fierce defence mechanisms can only hold out for so long, especially when Adrien turns on her too. She seeks comfort in her uncle’s company, the only person truly willing to be honest with her. (The only person who seems to truly understand her.) Even dying Amin is fiercely alive, his mouth fixed into a grin like he understands a joke no one else is in on, as he’s begging Alpha and her mother to let him go. It’s a towering performance of pathos but not pity from Tahar Rahim, and the newcomer Mélissa Boros, with her expressive eyes and wild animal physicality, is a revelation as his foil. There’s such loneliness here, of a teenage girl, a single mother, a drug addict and scores of the sick, pushed to the fringes and bound by their isolation. Meanwhile the timeline slips between the past and present, as Alpha’s exhausted mother becomes just like her own, grasping at old superstitions. Her rational, scientific mind is traumatised by her own experience and Amin’s illness as well as the new threat to her daughter; she remembers how her mother used to think Amin was sick with​‘The Red Wind’ and could be cleansed with water. In her grief she’s willing to believe in anything that might give her a little longer with a loved one. It’s become a running joke how many films seem to revolve around the vague concept of grief these days, but considering it’s only five years since a global pandemic, it’s understandable that the collective process of mourning continues to dominate art and culture. While Covid was largely different from theAIDSpandemic due to the inherently homophobic and classist narrative pedalled during the70s and80s that led to thousands more deaths and delays in healthcare advancement, it’s hard to not see the frozen stone statues ofAlphaand think of how our collective relationship to death might have changed as a result of what we lived through (then and now). What’s more, grief is an undeniable part of the human experience: to love someone is to eventually grieve them. It’s an inherently vulnerable act, andAlphais an inherently vulnerable film, no gross-out moments or big body horror showstoppers for us – or Ducournau – to hide behind.Alphais as thorny as her previous two features, but there’s something lonely and longing here too. But if death is a part of life, so is dancing. Kissing. Laughing. Running. Holding a ladybird in the palm of your hand, gentle and awed, or arguing with someone who loves you down to your bones. For all its cool stone,Alphais not a cold film, and vibrates withlifein the wayRawpulsed with desire andTitanewith white-hot fury. Grieving is a process of letting go, but it’s also a process of finding the parts of people we’ve lost that eventually become a part of us – of learning how to carry on even as we can’t forget.",Hannah Strong,"Raw, of, Titane, life"

In the space of just over a year, Perkins has established himself as one of the most prominent names in contemporary horror, delivering one of2024’s most divisive films,Longlegs,before swiftly following that up with an enjoyable albeit underwhelming Stephen King adaptation,The Monkey. Sure enough, his latest effort,Keeper, is set to be followed by another feature set to be released next year. You’ve got to admire the man’s enthusiasm, but pal, what’s the rush? Perkins brings us along to a secluded woodland cabin where his protagonist, Liz – an artist played brilliantly by Tatiana Maslany – goes on a romantic getaway with her doctor boyfriend, Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland). The cabin itself is all sleek lines, dark timber adorned by contemporary artwork and vast, unshuttered windows staring straight into the woods, captured in wide-angle shots creating an ominous sense of looming danger. And, surprise, surprise, none of the doors seem to lock either. Like M Night Shyamalan’s recent entry to the cabin in the woods horror canon,Knock at the Cabin,Keeperuses the confined space to explore intimacy and isolation, but where Shyamalan’s cabin manages to create urgency in its claustrophobia, Perkins’ stark interiors are constantly exposed to the outside world, making sure the forest is always watching. The couple’s evening together is interrupted by Malcolm’s insufferable cousin, Darren (Birkett Turton), who storms in uninvited, brandishing his (offensively thinly-sketched) Eastern European girlfriend Minka (Eden Weiss), and asking for a moment of Malcolm’s time. For the brief moment that the two women are left alone, Minka coldly glances at the cake on the kitchen counter and warns Liz that​“it tastes like shit”. When the couple are left alone again, Malcolm won’t take no for an answer when it comes to Liz having a slice of cake, even though she​“hates chocolate”, and soon, the cake oddly ends up becoming one very overdetermined prop. Malcolm is eager to pamper Liz, yet unspoken disappointments and the overarching question of how well these two really know one another undercut their relationship. When he has to make an unexpected return to the city, she’s left alone, tripping on cake as the cabin begins to produce disquieting flashes in the form of various feminine demons that certainlylookthe part, but don’t seem to fit or belong to a coherent enough paranormal world. They appear suddenly as arbitrary intrusions, as a series of creepy visual shocks, and it’s almost as if the priority lies with layering them for their aesthetic punch, resulting in a cabin of visually striking, yet hollow, chaotic and disconnected spirits. To add insult to injury, just when things are finally about to get nasty, a character effectively sits us down for a tedious exposition dump that explains the whats, whys and hows of it all. It’s this very lack of trust in its viewers that comes as the film’s most upsetting development, especially as it echoesLonglegs’ own Achilles heel. By this point, Nick Lepard’s screenplay is equally, if not more, responsible for suffocating what little ambiguity is left. There is ultimately no palpable desire to make the film’s emotional or genre undercurrents connect on any level. So, onto the next one it is, but please, no reason for such haste!",Marina Ashioti,"Longlegs, look, The Monkey, Longlegs,, Knock at the Cabin"
029f57ff-c31a-4777-abad-85da3916de52,Little White Lies,https://lwlies.com/reviews/blue-moon,Blue Moon,25 Nov 2025,3.33,"In2025, the writer/​director Richard Linklater debuted two new features about revolutionary artists at vital junctures of their respective careers.Nouvelle Vague(which comes to these shores in early2026) captures the irrepressible creative zeal of Jean-Luc Godard and his ragtag crew while makingBreathlesson the streets of Paris.Blue Moon, meanwhile, captures a giant of early-20th-century musical theatre en route to the gutter. It’s March31,1943, and the soon-to-be-canonical Broadway smash,​‘Oklahoma!’, has just premiered to rave reviews. We join the diminutive lyricist Lorenz Hart (Ethan Hawke) as he props up the bar at the New York thesp haunt Sardi’s. His viperish assessment confirms that he is no fan of what he sees as earnest, audience-pandering romanticism.​‘Oklahoma!’, it transpires, is a new work by Hart’s long-time musical partner, Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott), who has chosen to work with a new lyricist, Oscar Hammerstein (Simon Delaney). Hart is sour that he is no longer the focus of industry plaudits, yet half- heartedly attempts to hide his scorn. The story identifies this moment as a turning point in Hart’s career, where his catty manner and rampant alcoholism have made him a professional liability, and there’s a sense that an exasperated Rodgers almost sees this as revenge for so much unbecoming behaviour. Hawke plays Hart as a raconteur and wit, a saucy barfly whose lack of self control and easy recourse to deception and self-depreciation recalls Ray Milland’s character in the1945alcoholism drama,The Lost Weekend. It’s an appealing character turn that never attempts to apologise for Hart’s challenging personality, much more than mere learnt tics and accent work, and a real immersion in the (lost) soul of an artist out of time. There’s also excellent work from Bobby Cannavale as world-weary barman Eddie, who humours and enables the self-destructive Hart while offering him some much needed camaraderie along with the hooch. The film is talky and stagebound, yet cinematographer Shane F Kelly manages to create pockets of intrigue within the layout of the bar. Hart talks the ear off of anyone who will listen, including an exasperatedEBWhite, who’s just in for a few quiet ones. Its eventual dramatic crux takes the form of a hoped-for bunk-up with a young student (Margaret Qualley), but there’s been far too much clunky foreshadowing put in place for the outcome to be a surprise. Unfortunately, about halfway in, the film becomes an exercise in ritual humiliation, with Linklater and the screenwriter Robert Kaplow piling up the indignities at an almost metaphorically swift rate, as if to assure the viewer that our charismatic hero is most definitely done for. There are points here where it feels as if Linklater was trying to make a gender-switched version of Fassbinder’s tragicThe Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant, but without really leaning into the forceful bitterness and agency of the protagonist, and opting to have the text make a more profound point about the precarious nature of power and influence.",David Jenkins,"Nouvelle Vague, Breathless, The Lost Weekend, The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant"

Fronted by the journalist Chris Hansen, the44-minute episodes became must-seeTV, as law enforcement set up sting operations around theUSto lure sex offenders into the open using actual minors as decoys. The series was also directly responsible for the suicide of a government official, who shot himself shortly after the production team arrived at his house. Soon after that, the show was cancelled, but the genie was out of the bottle. Such a fascinating and formative example of the True Crime Industrial Complex seems ripe for appraisal – inPredators, documentary filmmaker David Osit tracks down some of the people closest to the source, including former child decoys, arresting officers, influenced imitators and even Hansen. Osit is largely observational at first, content to let his subjects talk candidly about their memories and perception of the series. Many still see it as a watershed moment for children’s safety, highlighting the dangers of unchecked social media use for children where anyone on the internet could be harbouring ill intent. It’s uncomfortable and often disturbing viewing, but Osit’s unsentimental, self-critical and refreshingly thoughtful approach makesPredatorsone of the most valuable entries into a saturated genre, prioritising ethics over emotion.",Hannah Strong,To Catch a Predator

Croatian filmmaker Igor Bezinović establishes early on that this is a pocket of military history that not many people know of, including the residents of Rijeka (née Fiume), a dinky port city that became a disputed territory in the post-World War One carve-up of Europe. He wanders around with his microphone asking locals and tourists if they know who d’Annunzio was, and it takes a fair few blank-faced​“guhs?” before he finally receives some vague acknowledgement of his controversial subject. Stories about far-right takeovers seem like they would be especially pertinent in today’s climate as one of the world’s superpowers is having its having its democratic roots tested to the extreme, yet it proves that this type of aggressive political opportunism, mounted by entitled men who just happen to look like freaks, is common to say the least. All of which is to say, these stories are always relevant, sadly. What’s interesting in this specific case is we discover that d’Annunzio did not have the support of the Italian government in his endeavours, so this was essentially a solo mission aided by a rag-tag gathering of​“legionnaires” picked up on the way.Fiume o morte!explores the dangerous, empowering nature of fascism, and how certain forms of aggression would seem fair game under a régime that rules by such inhumane edict. Bezinović’s plan for this film is to bring the complex machinations of the coup and its immediate fall-out to life, with members of the local community mucking in and playing all the key roles. Aside from it feeling like a worthwhile community project which allows residents to reconnect with the roots of their landscape, the film also operates as an allegory for the creation of collective art and how we must turn the perceived flaws of our collaborators into advantages. Part of the fun ofFiume o morte!is watching how the locals slink into their roles and gain confidence as things move forward – some eventually going all-out to achieve dramatic authenticity. This connects to the fact that Fiume itself, under d’Annunzio, had become a haven for artists and radicals to hone their craft, and the film gains a radical edge in the fact that Bezinović accepts the leaders invite, but with view to criticising rather than celebrating his actions.",David Jenkins,

Shackleton leans into endearing Beavis and Butt-Head-lite snickering in his narration, which comes as a result of it feeling more like a live director’s commentary than something more manicured and formalised. Yet he also proves that you don’t need invasive recreations and contrived structuring to wring atmosphere from this type of material, as he demonstrates via numerous passages of description spoken over still landscape shots (captured on nostalgic16mm film by cinematographer Xenia Patricia). And while there’s a sense that the thesis here lacks originality, there are enough audiovisual flights of fancy to keep the cheeky intellectual jiggery-pokery ticking along nicely.",David Jenkins,would
c8838441-f63b-435d-a880-871fd5c65889,Little White Lies,https://lwlies.com/reviews/the-ice-tower,The Ice Tower,19 Nov 2025,5.0,"Like her shortLa Bouche De Jean-Pierre(1996) and her featuresInnocence(2004),Evolution(2015) andEarwig(2021), Lucile Hadžihalilović’s latest,The Ice Tower, offers an unnerving, surreal take on a young person’s coming of age. It begins with a female voiceover narrating part of Hans Christian Andersen’s​‘The Snow Queen’, accompanied by a fragmented kaleidoscope of snow-globe images (icy mountains, a tower) as though filtered through the distorting prisms of a crystal. Jeanne (Clara Pacini) not only knows​‘The Snow Queen’ by heart, she also lives in a wintry, Alpine village whose snow white sierra resembles the illustrations from the book, which she regularly reads to her much younger foster sister, Rose. Not as old as she claims to be, but yearning precociously to get out into the adult world, Jeanne runs away from the warmth and comfort of her foster home on a quest for mother love. What in fact she will find is her own sexual objectification, as well as a model of icy resilience and strength in Cristina van den Berg (Marion Cotillard), a middle-aged actor who is now playing the Snow Queen in a film production at the studio building where Jeanne has sought refuge from the elements. From the moment Jeanne first sees Cristina, resplendent and imperious in her sparkling costume, she is enchanted by this strange, beautiful woman who insists on always getting her way, and has the director, Dino (Gaspar Noé), cast and crew terrified of her diva-like behaviour. Cristina has also noticed Jeanne and is quick to take the young girl under her wing – although what exactly she wants from Jeanne is not at first clear in a scenario where both are performing a role and both are impostors. What is clear is that Cristina was herself once a foster child, and for her, the chilling damage has long since settled into permafrost, so that she is trapped in her own cycles and addictions, and readily corrupts those around her. So whether Cristina offers an exemplary fable or a cautionary tale, she embodies a possible future for Jeanne (and Rose), unless – like Gerda in​‘The Snow Queen’ – they can escape the icy grip of destiny. Here an established fairy tale is combined with a fantasy film (and its behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings), and with the anxious, aching dream life of an adolescent, with the result that Andersen is fostered in the same household as David Lynch’sEraserhead(1977) andMulholland Dr.(2001), and even Leni Riefenstahl’s TheBlue Light(1932). For this is, from beginning to end, a Bergfilm, much as Cristina’s surname is van den Berg, which, with its spurious intimations of nobility, may be as pseudonymous as Jeanne’s own adopted identity,​‘Bianca’ (bringing her close to Snow White). The Ice Toweris as fragile and delicate as a snowflake, as disorientating and mysterious as adolescence, and as dark as a winter’s night. For it is a shadowy frío-noir, complete with femme fatale, even as its elusive, edgy narrative is passed down, like keepsake beads or diffracting crystals, from generation to generation.",Anton Bitel,"Eraserhead, Earwig, Mulholland Dr., Evolution, Innocence, La Bouche De Jean-Pierre, Blue Light"
c4d70fcb-4f3b-444c-abd0-e367241cfd1d,Little White Lies,https://lwlies.com/reviews/the-thing-with-feathers-review,The Thing With Feathers,13 Nov 2025,2.33,"Gluttons for emotional punishment would do well to seek out Dylan Southern’sThe Thing with Feathers, an ickily-stylised screen adaptation of Max Porter’s hit2019novel​‘Grief is a Thing with Feathers’. It’s telling that they’ve removed the marketing turn-off term​“grief” from the title, but the fact is, you’d need to have a media literacy score of minus3000to not get what this film is selling, as a ghostly humanoid crow verbally harangues and demeans a father and his two kids in the direct wake of their wife/mother’s sudden death. And that grief is laid on with an over-sized trowel as the we have Benedict Cumberbatch doing wall-to-wall ugly crying as a cartoonist (don’t say​“graphic novelist,” as apparently it sounds wanky) who’s forced to face up to his manifold deficiencies as a primary carer and is presented (quite wankily) as the archetype​“Dad”. His two young​“Boys” (Richard and Henry Boxall) can’t really comprehend the gravity of the situation, and there’s an instant and moving clash when Dad realises that there’s little common understanding in the house at this moment of sublime rupture. During the long, boozy nights of contemplation and worry that the world can never be the same again, Dad is jolted out of his reverie by the loud knock of a bird Kamikaze-diving into the window (à la Hitchcock’sThe Birds), clearly trying to invade the house and, eventually, get into the heads of all the inhabitants. Eventually, all this malevolent wildlife manifests as Crow, a hunched, lifesized crow voiced by David Thewlis who’s channeling an even more aggressive, irritating and comically Northern version of his character Johnny fromNaked. The film is split into chapters which detail how Dad and the Boys interact with Crow and how, through Crow’s oppressive rantings, everyone is eventually dragged towards some semblance of comprehension and peace. Where the story works in the pages of the novel as a literary device that can be imagined by the reader, presenting a screen version with an actual physical presence completely drains any nuance from the story. Doing it this way somehow feels like the easy way out, both diluting and formalising a complex process of healing that is likely going to be different for everyone who experiences it. The film so desperately wants you to shed tears alongside its crestfallen protagonists, yet the veneer of toughness (which occasionally comes across as horror-adjacent) covers a heart that is wholly sentimental. Another aspect that sticks in the craw is the idea that this occurrence allows Dad to hover haughtily above his peers and acquaintances, and there are numerous awkward scenes of people offering to help as Cumberbatch demures, wondering how anyone could even begin to fathom his dismal headspace. Empathy and civility are cynically brushed off as performative and self-soothing, as if the film wants you only to believe in the restorative methods that it’s selling. There’s a few decent performances in the mix (the kids especially), and Cumberbatch goes all-in (and then some) on the concept, but otherwise this flails as saccharine self-help cinema without any real sense of authentic human behaviour.",N/A,"The Thing with Feathers, Naked, The Birds"

From the outset, it’s a physically demanding role thatBessant throws himself into with gruelling believability, spending much of the film’s runtime hanging upside down, battered and hopeless. David is no hero, however, and scattered snapshots of his dubious past give us little cause to root for him. Gamemay be set on the fringes of the​’90s rave scene, but it most certainly isn’t a film about having a good time in a field – quite the opposite, actually. For his startlingly assured feature debut, Bristol-based filmmaker John Minton has crafted a tale that’s entirely about the comedown – and it’s a crushing one at that. David’s short-lived hope of saviour comes in the form of a nameless poacher, played with quiet menace and morbid wit by Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson. If you’ve ever wondered what might happen if you wound up concussed and delirious in a secluded forest,Gamehas a few extremely unpleasant ideas. Williamson’s performance seethes with contempt – not just for David, but for the rave culture pulsing around the film’s edges – a world his character clearly sees as a threat to his rural way of life. When Williamson arrives on the scene, he already has a fairly reasonable axe to grind: the film’s most disturbing moment arrives with an act of brutal self-defense on David’s part, paving the way for a fractious, if bleakly amusing exchange between our two leads. Fair warning to fans of pooches: some may find it excruciatingly difficult to stomach. If that wasn’t enough to draw the poacher’s ire, David’s apparent links with rave hedonism prove to be the tipping point. Williamson’s character duly sets about chastising him with a barrage of c‑words and not-all-that-unreasonable observations about the wasteful, selfish nature of throwaway party culture. In a nutshell, he’s the last person you’d expect to take kindly to aDJ’s request to​“make some noise”. This is something of a passion project for co-writer Geoff Barrow, best known for his work with bands Portishead andBEAK. Alongside Minton, Bessant and comic book writer Rob Williams, who is also credited for the screenplay, all involved clearly have an affinity for the sound of the era. Barrow and his regular collaborator Ben Salisbury provide the film’s sparse score accompanied by thumping rave motifs, courtesy of electronic musician Jamie Paton, punctuating staccato synth blasts and moody ambience that needles the tension tighter. When the contents of David’s bag of illicit substances come into play,Gameevolves into something altogether stranger, nodding to the darker, more dangerous side of the rave scene. Shot in and around the city, the hush of Bristol’s surrounding woodland quickly becomes a canvas for lurid psychedelia. Flashbacks hum and unsettling hallucinations seep in as we veer into visual territory reminiscent of the infamous trip scenes of Ben Wheatley’sA Field in England. Your mileage may vary here depending on your tolerance for wacky visual flair, but it’s mercifully short-lived. As those familiar with its creators’ worldview might expect,Game​’s greatest strength lies in its distinct brand of humour. Its darkest beats are laced with the same kind of cynical wit that anyoneau faitwith Williamson’s acerbic lyrical delivery, or the world-weary observations of Barrow’s defunct Twitter feed might expect. For newcomers, it offers tight, compelling genre thrills as two disparate, quietly unlikable characters collide, with neither emerging from the wreckage unscathed. There may not be much in the way of character development, but the darkly humorous moments and collision of rave-era messiness and rural menace result in a lean, low-budget, feral thriller.",Paul Weedon,"au fait, A Field in England"
